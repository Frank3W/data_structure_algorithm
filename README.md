[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Frank3W/data_structure_algorithm.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/Frank3W/data_structure_algorithm)

Python implementation of classic data structure and algorithms:

- linked list
    - reverse
    - reverse in k-item group
    - even and odd reallocation
    - fetch middle element
    - concatenate
    - alternative merge
    - sampling
- queue (based on linked list)
- stack (based on linked list)
- array
    - sequence
        - remove duplicates
        - rotate to right by k positions
        - reverse
    - integer sequence
        - maximum sum of the contiguous subarray
        - move all negatives to front
        - longest consecutive subsequence
- binary tree
    - depth first search in recerstive manner (preorder, inorder, postorder)
    - depth first search via stack (preorder, inorder, postorder)
    - breadth first search via queue
    - tree viwer (left, top, bottom)
    - printable string of a tree
    - compute tree height
    - validate binary search tree
    - find largest binary search subtree
    - validate symmetric tree
    - all paths from root to leaves
    - least common ancestor (find path from two leaves)
    - conversion to double linked list
    - invert tree to mirror
    - diameter of a binary tree
